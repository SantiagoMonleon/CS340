        <h4>We have got DELETE functionality working, but the UPDATE is not working. </h4>
        <h4>The query executes but it does not update the database, we do not know what is wrong with it.</h4>
        <h4>We were having trouble with handlebars and getting express working so we kept the UI very simple, we will be updated it soon.</h4>
